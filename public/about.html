<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Aamina Begam , a curious and enthusiastic tech explorer pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Communication Engineering. With a passion for problem-solving and a knack for creative thinking, I enjoy diving into coding projects, experimenting with new tools, and turning challenges into opportunities for growth.</p>

 <p> I’ve worked on projects like RescueFS, focusing on filesystem recovery, and an Automatic Pill Dispenser, blending innovation with practicality. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning Java and Visual Studio Code, while also exploring the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding or brainstorming ideas, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, organizing my thoughts with a good book, or collaborating with peers on LinkedIn.</p>
